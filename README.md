## Built With

- **React with TypeScript & Redux Toolkit:** We utilized React with TypeScript for building a robust and type-safe frontend, along with Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.

- **Flex and Grid Layouts:** Leveraging Flexbox for straightforward layouts and Grid for more complex designs allowed us to achieve precise control over rows and columns, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout.

- **SCSS:** We adopted SCSS (Sass) for our styling needs, enabling us to write cleaner and more maintainable CSS code. SCSS features like variables and etc.

- **React Router:** For handling client-side routing in our application, we employed React Router. This allowed us to create dynamic and seamless navigation experiences, enabling users to move between different views of our application without full page reloads. With React Router, we were able to define routes, render components based on the current URL, and manage navigation states effectively, enhancing the overall user experience.
